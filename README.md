***Who made this?***
This is a Discord Bot made by Me aka Mahraam#5124 on discord.

***What language was it made with?***
It's written in Python with Discord.PY.

***Why it's called Spyde?***
This name randomly came to my mind.

***Why I made this?***
I really love Python and programming and I was on Discord for like 24/7,
And I saw a lot of people are using and making discord bots,
So I made my own discord bot so other people can use it.

**The Commands:**

*You can get the prefix with mentioning the bot or with the `prefix show`* command,
*Right now it's `,s`*,
*But you can change it with `prefix set`* command,
*And reset it with `prefix reset`* command.

***Welcomer & Goodbyer:***

For setting up the welcomer you just need to do `welcome toggle` command, it will turn on the welcomer,
And you can change the message with `welcome message <message>` command,
Just to make sure that you add `.guild` and `.member` in the message,
`.guild` for the guild name in the message,
`.member` for mentioning the user in the message,
You can turn off the welcomer with `welcome toggle` command,
And you can change the channel with `welcome channel <channel>` command,
And you can get the status for welcomer with `welcome status` command,

These goes for goodbyer as well,
`goodbye toggle` and `goodbye message <message>` and `goodbye channel <channel>` and `goodbye status`.
